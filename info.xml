  <name>Prevent users to overwrite their record</name>
  <description>Civi by default pre-select your own contact details when you register to an event (or other public visible forms, like donation or membership) if you are logged in. It is generally a good thing, but might lead to errors, for instance when a team member overwrite their own contact record while trying to register a new member, or if one forward an invitation they received to someone else.
This extension put the first and last name fields read only, to prevent these mistake
